Querying with LINQ To SQL
The rules for executing a query with LINQ to SQL is similiar to that of a standard 
LINQ query i.e. query is executted either deferred or immediate. There are various 
components that play a role in execution of a query with LINQ to SQL and these are 
the following ones.

LINQ to SQL API – requests query execution on behalf of an application and sent it
to LINQ to SQL Provider

LINQ to SQL Provider - converts query to Transact SQL(T-SQL) and sends the new query
to the ADO Provider for execution

ADO Provider - After execution of the query, send the results in the form of a 
DataReader to LINQ to SQL Provider which in turn converts it into a form of user 
object

It should be noted that before executing a LINQ to SQL query, it is vital to 
connect to the data source via DataContext class.
